## Basic knowledge of using linux shell

It is easy to find information and basic training on line. If you do not know which to follow, we recommend you to follow this to start: 

[The Unix Shell for novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

## Get access

You can access all three servers directly within Leiden University network. When you do not have access to the university network, you need to jump through Leiden University ssh gateway, for this, you need your ULCN account.

Please fill in the form "Request access SSH-gateway" on [this page](https://www.staff.universiteitleiden.nl/ict/help-and-support/application-forms/application-forms/service-units/ict-shared-service-centre) and wait for approval. Then you can set it up follow [this tutorial](https://www.staff.universiteitleiden.nl/binaries/content/assets/ul2staff/ict/handleidingen/manual-setting-up-ssh-gateway-2017-eng.pdf).

To ask for access to all servers, please send email to me (c.du\[at\]biology.leidenuniv.nl) or Edder Bustos Diaz (for Paco Lab only, e.d.bustos.diaz\[at\]biology.leidenuniv.nl). Please let us know the following info:

- The user name you want to use for login. Only lower case letters and numbers allowed, start with letters. It is OK that you use the same user name as your ULCN account.
- Your first name
- Your last name
- The group you come from (your supervisor)
- The analysis you want to do (generally)

We will provide you information needed for accessing our servers.

Currently we are using Slack group "IBL-Bioinformatic" for discussion and most importantly, send notifications about all servers. Please ask for access.
