# Server configurations

## Data and backup

As a small server cluster intended for testing and teaching, we **do not** plan to backup any data you upload to the servers. Please remove your data when it is not needed.

## Home directory quota explained

Except BILBO, you will have limited storage space in your `/home/user` directory. This is meant for supporting as much users as possible. The `/home` directory is located in SSD and should be fast, it is intended to store scripts that you made, programs that you compile that do not fit for sharing, or some temporary files generated by your program.

Find how much you have used using the following commands:

```sh
[username@blis ~]$ quota -s
Disk quotas for user username (uid 168888888):
     Filesystem   space   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
/dev/mapper/rl-home
                   785M  20480M  25600M           14081       0       0

[username@blis ~]$ du -d 0 -h ~/
785M    /home/username/

```

Please do not try to overload the quotation even if you find out that you are not listed in the quotation system. It may be a mistake that might be fixed at anytime.

You can overrun the system to "limit", but cannot exceed it. The file system will block you from writting any new stuff in. If this happened during your job which writes to `~` directory, the job will fail. You need to run all data IO heavy jobs from the shared storage. For that, please check carefully the program you want to use for its temporary and output data location.

Contact server adminstrators in our SLACK group if you really need larger `~` directory.

## Micromamba instead of Conda

### Reasoning

### How

## Jump within servers

You can jump using `ssh [servername (lowercases)]` to any of the above listed servers.

### Check os version
