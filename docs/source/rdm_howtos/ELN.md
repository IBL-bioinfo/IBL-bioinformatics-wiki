IBL is **hosting** a ELN server providing a web application called Research Space (RSpace) <span style="background-color:#2558A4;padding:0.2rem;border-radius:3px;display:inline-flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;width:58px"> <img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ffc384cb3a51a7b1c2d57ad/6239f62a33bc35909f6f9a87_rspace_logo_white.svg" alt="RSpace"></span>.

Adopting an ELN can feel awkward if you’re used to paper notebooks. Take it slowly and try things out with your group. Start by using the ELN simply as a cloud notebook: create entries, add text, and attach images. 

Practical tips:
- Begin with basic, frequent entries to build the habit; don’t try to move everything at once.
- Use the mobile app to upload photos of plates, gels or notes, but do not record or process sensitive or confidential data on personal devices — prefer institutional devices for that.
- Use templates, tags and clear titles to make notes easy to find later.
- Keep regular exports or backups of important notebooks where possible.
- Ask colleagues or ELN support for demonstrations and share experiences within your group.

## Setup autosharing within group

- Go to [Universeit Leiden RSpace](https://leiden.researchspace.com) and login with your ULCN account
Share all labjournals of all users with everyone in the whole group:
- Go to my RSpace and activate autosharing, like this all items you create will be shared with the whole group
Share a single notebook with all users in the group:
- If you only want to share a single notebook that is shared with everyone in the group please create that notebook in the shared folder of the group
Share a single notebook with users/groups within or outside the current group
- If you want to share a single notebook select that notebook, and click the share icon. Select the user or group and save the changes. Here you can also share to all users
